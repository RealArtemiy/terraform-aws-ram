    version       = "~> 1.0"
    name          = "Share Subnets to develop account"
    resource_arns = ["arn:aws:ec2:eu-central-1:123456789101:subnet/subnet-1234567abcd", "arn:aws:ec2:eu-central-1:123456789101:subnet/subnet-abcdef1234"]
    principals    = ["arn:aws:organizations::101987654321:organization/o-abcdef1234", "123456789101"]
    tags = {
      OwnedBy = "network"
    }
  }
  ```
  For organization unit - need to use ARN, but not o-XXXXXXXXXX id, arn can be taken by simply running: `$ aws organizations describe-organization`
